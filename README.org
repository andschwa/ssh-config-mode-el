* ssh-config-mode.el

A mode to edit SSH config files.

It does the following:

- Fontifys the SSH config keywords.
- Keys for skipping from host section to host section.
- Indentation of configuration found in the following locations:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
.ssh/config
sshd?_config
known_hosts
authorized_keys2?
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you have a SSH config file that you'd like to use this mode on
automatically, every time you open it, set it up like this:

:  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/path-to-your-ssh/config\\'" . ssh-config-mode))
